### Day job

My thing is to be in-between: users with needs, technology with limitations and organisations with goals.

I do programming, graphics, UX, research, support and more. I’m value-driven, creative and ambitious.

Since 2002 I have worked with digital communication in music labels, restaurants and large public sector organisations. -->
